# Auction-Theory-Q-Learning

This script uses Q Learning to attempt to find optimal policy for bidders in an auction. It attempts to take in other bidders' actions to find optimal strategies for bidders when the given state is dependant on other bidders' actions for a given "value" state, however it does not work and I have created a much simpler (but less useful) version of this model over at https://github.com/Lawnchair2/Simple-Auction-Sim. 

I may come back to this later, but only time can tell. I think that machine learning has many potential opportunities for use in auction theory and other game theory problems.
